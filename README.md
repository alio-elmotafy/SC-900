# E-commerce Customer Data Analysis

This repository presents a **dual approach** to analyzing e-commerce customer data using **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and **pandas in Python** for deep data processing. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, sales performance, product trends, and more, giving business stakeholders actionable insights to drive marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance profitability.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to understand **customer behavior** and **sales trends** for an e-commerce business. By integrating **Power BI's** interactive dashboards and **Python's** data manipulation capabilities, we provide a comprehensive analysis that can be used to enhance business performance.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Power BI**: Visualizing customer segmentation, sales trends, and KPIs.
- **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)**: Data cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering.

This README serves as a guide to understanding the workflow, key features, and instructions to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify high-value customers.
2. **Sales Trend Analysis**: Visualizing sales over time, identifying seasonal trends, and forecasting future sales.
3. **Product Performance**: Analyzing which product categories and individual products contribute the most to revenue.
4. **Geographic Sales Distribution**: Identifying top-performing regions and areas for potential growth.
5. **Customer Retention**: Exploring customer lifetime value (CLV) and repeat purchase behavior.

---

## Data Description

The dataset used includes the following features:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Order Date**: Date of transaction.
- **Product Category**: Type of product purchased.
- **Quantity**: Number of items in each order.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated for each transaction.
- **Region**: Geographic region of the customer.

The dataset is processed using **pandas** for cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. It is then visualized using **Power BI** for comprehensive insights.

## Project Workflow

This project follows the steps below:

1. **Data Import**: Data is imported and cleaned using **pandas**.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Calculating new metrics such as CLV, AOV (average order value), and customer retention rates.
4. **Power BI Dashboards**: Building interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends, geographic performance, and customer segmentation.
5. **Conclusions**: Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Power BI Dashboards

Power BI is used to create **interactive visualizations** that provide business-critical insights. Below are some of the key dashboards included in the Power BI file:

### 1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Segments customers based on their purchase history (RFM analysis).
   - Provides a visual breakdown of high-value customers and identifies trends in their purchasing behavior.

### 2. **Sales Performance**
   - Displays overall sales performance metrics (monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales).
   - Helps in identifying high-performing product categories.

### 3. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Visualizes sales by region, helping stakeholders understand the geographical impact on sales.
   - Identifies regions for potential marketing and sales efforts.

These dashboards allow for **interactive filtering**, enabling deeper dives into specific product categories, regions, or customer groups.

## Python (pandas) Analysis

The **pandas** analysis in the Jupyter notebook (`newscript.ipynb`) includes:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, type conversions, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating summary statistics and visualizations for sales and customer data.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Using the RFM model to classify customers into high, medium, and low-value segments.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Investigating which products and categories generate the most revenue.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Calculating the average revenue generated per customer over time.

---

## Results & Insights

The analysis led to several **key findings**:

1. **High-Value Customers**: A small percentage of customers account for a large portion of the revenue. These customers are ideal candidates for targeted marketing campaigns.
2. **Seasonal Trends**: Sales are highly seasonal, with significant spikes during the holiday season. This insight helps in inventory planning and marketing efforts.
3. **Regional Insights**: Certain regions consistently outperform others, suggesting opportunities for geographic expansion.
4. **Product Optimization**: Some product categories are underperforming, indicating potential for either discontinuation or marketing push.

---

## Future Work

- **Predictive Analytics**: Using machine learning to predict future customer behavior and sales trends.
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: Identifying customers at risk of not returning and targeting them with retention strategies.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrating social media or review data to understand customer sentiment toward products.
